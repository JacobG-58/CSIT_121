        <p>The proccess of learning what html is and how to apply what 
           ive learned to create my own webpages has been an enjoyable experience.
           After going through the learning material and doing a bit of research, I
           had a decent idea of how to approach utilizing html to build a webpage.
           While my knowledge of the html syntax is still on a basic level of 
           comprehension, i think my limited experience with programming
           languages has helped in the memorization aspect of basic tags and 
           structures. If i was having trouble remembering information, I would reference
           the <strong>Element Reference Website</strong> that was provided in the learning material.

        <ol>
            <li>Tags are declared by the bracket symbols surrounding them.</li>
            
            <li>The format for a basic html page includes: <br><b>(Doctype Declaration</b>, <b>Head</b>, <b>Title</b>,
            <b>Body</b>, <b>Headers</b>, <b>Paragraphs</b>, and <b>Closures Of All Tags Listed.)</b></li>
    
            <li>To close a tag, you must add a forward slash (/) before the its signifying letters.<br> Example: <i> "head" closes with "/head"</i></li>
        </ol>
