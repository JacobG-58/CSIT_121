        <p>The proccess of learning what html is and how to apply what 
           ive learned to create my own webpages has been an enjoyable experience.
           After going through the learning material and doing a bit of research, I
           had a decent idea of how to approach utilizing html to build a webpage.
           While my knowledge of the html syntax is still on a basic level of 
           comprehension, i think my limited experience with programming
           languages has helped in the memorization aspect of basic tags and 
           structures. If i was having trouble remembering information, I would reference
           the <strong>Element Reference Website</strong> that was provided in the learning material.
        </p>

        <h2>What I learned</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Tags are declared by the bracket symbols surrounding them.</li>
            
            <li>The format for a basic html page includes: <br><b>(Doctype Declaration</b>, <b>Head</b>, <b>Title</b>,
            <b>Body</b>, <b>Headers</b>, <b>Paragraphs</b>, and <b>Closures Of All Tags Listed.)</b></li>
    
            <li>To close a tag, you must add a forward slash (/) before the its signifying letters.<br> Example: <i> "head" closes with "/head"</i></li>
        </ol>

        <p>I have spent some time learning about the basics of CSS and howw it can be effectively used to
            alter the styling of a web page, thus giving the user a more enjoyable experience. Similarly to HTML the syntax
            is composed of elements, that are used to assign various styling options to different assets.
            CSS elements have been easier to remember for me because their name is more descriptive and the parameters within each
            element are fairly straightforward on a surface level. However, it can become more tricky when determining what elements
            should be assigned to which text, and can get overwheleming if you want a higher level of stylish diversity. This is where
            selectors come in; id and class selectors make a world of difference when trying to diversify style in your webpage 
            because they allow you to set styling rules that can be applied specifically to certain parts of your html file.
        </p>

        <h2>What I learned</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Class selectors must come after a "." id selctors must come after a "#". </li>
            
            <li>A style sheet is a file that is referenced directly by an html file, containing rules and parameters that define
                the styling choices for a web page.
            </li>
    
            <li>When creating borders, it is often a good idea to follow them up with a padding style change
                in order to ensure that the content within the borders is not cramped and messy looking.
            </li>
        </ol>
